1.

showEM("cadler",mp1>.gov")

<br>
The error above was a load time error. I am missing a quote before mp1. 
<br>
<br>
2.
<br>
 /*
             The ShowEm () function displays a link to the user's e-mail address.
             The text of the user and e-mail server names are entered in
             reverse order to thwart e-mail harvesters.
        /*
<br>
The error above was a load time error. To end the comment. I put /*, where I was suppose to switch it and put */
<br>
<br>
3.
<br>
 else(rule==2);
<br>
	  {
<br>
	  document.write("3. STUDENTS WILL FOLLOW THE PCTI UNIFORM POLICY AS PER THE SIGNED UNIFORM AGREEMENT");
<br>
The error above is a logical error. I have the function rule going to the value 2. The value 2 is going to rule #3, where it should be going to rule #2.
<br>
<br>
4.
<br>
div ="links"
<br>
   span Quick Links</span>
<br>
The error above is a load time error. When I am assigning div to the value links, there must be id after div.
<br>
<br>
5.
<br>
function ShowClassRules(rules)
{
      if(rule==0);
<br>
	  {
<br>
      document.write("1. AT THE START OF EACH CLASS STUDENTS WILL BE IN THEIR ASSIGNED
SEATS WORKING ON THE DO NOW");
<br>
	else(rule==1);
<br>
The error above is a run time error. The parameters are rules, but the if statment is assigning rule to 0. That will not work because the parameters are different then the commands.
