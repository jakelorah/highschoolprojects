The 1st computer was invented on February 15th, 1946. ENIAC was the first electronic general-purpose computer. It was Turing-complete, digital, and could solve "a large class of numerical problems" through reprogramming. The computer was meant to improve your education in school, keep you busy, learn about what is happening all around the world, and communication. The computer was a huge breakthrough in this world. Everyone wanted one. Back then, only some people could afford to buy a computer. These days, almost every household owns a computer. But some people use computers in different ways. These days, much more advanced computers are invented, with a lot more stuff to do on them, such as social media, watching movies and tv shows, video chat, and much more. Unfortunately, some people in this world don't use computers the right way. There is a ton of cyber bullying going on the web right now. Cyber bullying is the use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature. Some people find that bullying people online is easier than bullying someone face to face. Here's an idea. Don't bully anyone at all! For an example, kids go on their computer, email or direct message the person you're bullying to, and make fun of them. This was never intended to happen on computers. Computers were meant for fun and educational purposes, not bullying. We must end cyber bullying because it is affecting the use of computers. Computers were invented to be positive and helpful, but now they are turning into bully zones.
