#Program Description: This program computes shipping costs.

#A: The error in part A is the word then. You can't put "then". You have to replace then with a colon.

#B: The error in part B is the sqrt. You have to say import math and instead of just sqrt, say math.sqrt.

#C: The error in part C is they only used one equal sign. In python, you must use two, ==, instead of just one.

#D: The error in part D is they only used one equal sign, when you have to use two in python for it to work. 

#E: The error in part E is there are too many if statements. You have to replace the if with elif.
