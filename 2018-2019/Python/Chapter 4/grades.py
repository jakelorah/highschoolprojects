#Program Description: This program computes information related to a sequence of grades obtained from the user. It computes the number of passing and failing grades, computes the average grade and finds the highest and lowest grade.


#Initialize the counter variables.
numPassing = 0
numFailing = 0

#Initialize the variables used to compute the average.
total = 0
count = 0

#Initialize the min and max variables
minGrade = 100.0
maxGrade = 0.0

#Use an event-controlled loop with a priming read to obtain the grades.
grade = float(input("Enter a grade or -1 to finish: "))
while grade >= 0.0 :
    #Increment the passinf or failing counter.
    if grade >= 60.0 :
        numPassing = numPassing + 1
    else :
        numFailing = numFailing + 1

    #Determine if the grade is the min or max grade
    if grade < minGrade :
        minGrade = grade
    if grade > maxGrade :
        maxGrade = grade

    #Add the grade to the running total.
    total = total + grade
    count = count + 1

    #Read the next grade.
    grade = float(input("Enter a grade or -1 to finish: "))

#Print the results.
if count > 0 :
    average = total / count
    print("The average grade is %.2f" % average)
    print("Number of passing grades is", numPassing)
    print("Number of failing grades is", numFailing)
    print("The maximum grade is %.2f" % maxGrade)
    print("The minimum grade is %.2f" % minGrade)
