#Program Description: This program computes the time required to double an investment.


#Create constant variables.
RATE = 5.0
INITIAL_BALANCE = 10000.0
TARGET = 2 * INITIAL_BALANCE

#Initialize variables used with the loop.
balance = INITIAL_BALANCE
year = 0

#Count the years required for the investment to double.
while balance < TARGET :
    year = year + 1
    interest = balance * RATE / 100
    balance = balance + interest

#Print the results.
    print("The investment doubled after", year, "years.")
