#Program Number: P2.4(2)
#Program Description: This program finds the distance, maximum, and minimum of two numbers.



#Creating my two variables with the two integers
intA=4
intB=9

#Printing my two variables with their values
print("My two numbers are 4 and 9")

#Creating the variable g, finding the max
g= max(intA,intB)

#Printing the result
print("The maximum is", g)

#Creating the variable g2, finding the minimum
g2= min(intA,intB)

#Printing the result
print("The minimum is", g2)

#Creating the variables g3 and g4, finding the distance
g3= intA-intB
g4= abs(g3)

#Printing the result
print("The distance between both numbers is", g4)
