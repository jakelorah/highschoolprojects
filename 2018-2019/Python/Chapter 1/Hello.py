#R1.1 Explain the difference between using a computer program and programming a computer

    #When you use a computer program, you run/execute a set of code a programmer wrote. When you program a computer, you are the programmer creating the lines of code to perform an action. One is running the code and the other is actually creating the code.

#R1.7 What does this program print? print("39 + 3")
#                                   print(39 + 3)

    #For this program, the first line will print out 39 + 3 and the second line will print out the answer which is 42. The first line is a string and the second line is numerical.
