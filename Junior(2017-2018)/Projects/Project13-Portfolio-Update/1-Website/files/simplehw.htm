These days, who doesn't have a smartphone? Mostly everyone in this world has one. And they use it A LOT. Why wouldn't you? You can go on social media, you can search the web, you can take pictures, and much more. Its a great invention, but you do have to charge that phone a lot. Thats the only annoying and costly part. I came up with a solution to save your electric bill from rising. Its called piggie power. Piggie power is a piggie bank shaped charger for your smartphone. The catch is that you have to pay in coins to charge your phone. Lets say you are at 30% and you want to charge your phone for 30 minutes before you leave for a party. You will have to insert 30 cents in the piggie power for 30 minutes. Let say you want to charge it for 10 minutes. You will have to insert 10 cents. And so on... The Piggie Power uses very little electricity but charges your phone fast. Mostly every kid charges their phone over night while they are sleeping. That uses a lot of electricity and could raise your electric bill pretty high. Now with piggie power you have to pay in coins to charge your phone. This will make kids second guess about using a lot of power and they will learn quickly that they don't need to charge there phone to 100% all the time. This product is currently available in Kohls and staples, but is slowly but steadly expanding to many more. This costs $50 at retail price. So go out and buy a piggie power to save your electric bill from going through the roof.
