<br>
I have worked with a team in previous projects in the past. An example is landscaping an old ladies house with the church I go to. We we're all a team because everyone had a different job which made the project faster and more effective. Some benifits working with the team are joint expertise and networking. First, joint expertise helps the team because everyone specialized in a certain part. A guy Sal knew how to use the weed wacker, I knew how to cut the lawn, etc.. We each had our skill that we we're all good at. Also, networking was a benefit with working as a team because we all came close and had fun. Everyone got along and had a good time. To be totally honest, there were no negative aspects to this project. This team I worked with is a healthy team because we all worked together to achieve a common goal on time and with quality. Everyone on the team knew exactly what to do and what the project is supposed to accomplish. Overall, this was a successful project.
