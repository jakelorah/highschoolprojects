<br>

<font size="5">
<b>Objective:</b>
<br>
The objective of the project is for my family to have easy access to pictures, calendars, events, and contact info on the web whenever they'd like.
<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b>
<br>
1) There must be a side bar on the left side of the page with links to different pages. Those pages are pictures, calendars, events, and contact info.
<br>
<br>
2) The color scheme of the website must be easy to read and not to crazy. I recommend all light colors.
<br>
<br>
3) The website must be private. Only certain people can access it by a code.
<br>
<br>
4) There must be music playing in the backround when you are on the website. Nice soothing music.
<br>
<br>
5) The pictures page must have a next and a back button when you go through the pictures.
<br>
<br>
6) There must be a comment page on the bottom of the page for feedback and suggestions.
<br>
<br>
7) The calendar page should have events and birthdays in the calendar and the events page should just be a list of all of the events.
<br>
<br>
8) The font should be either times new roman or comic sans for everything except the title of the page. That should be popping out. That font is up to you.
<br>
<br>
9) Contact info page should have name, phone number, email and address.
<br>
<br>
10) Pictures, calendars, events, and contact info pages must be easy to change around and add additional information to them. I recommend PDF files for those pages.
