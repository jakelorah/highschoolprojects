<br>
I have worked with a team in previous projects in the past. An example is landscaping an old ladies house with the church I go to. We we're all a team because everyone had a different job which made the project faster and more effectve. Some benifits working with the team are joint expertise and networking. First, joint expertise helps the team because everyone specialized in a certain part. A guy Sal knew how to use the weed wacker, I knew how to cut the lawn, etc.. We each had our seperate part that we we're all good at. Also, networking was a benefit with working as a team because we all came close and had fun. Everyone got along and had a good time. To be totally honest, there were no negative aspects to this project. We all worked together to clean up this house before it got dark and everything worked out.
