<br>
<br>
<font size="5">
<br>
<b>1) Weather:</b> We risked working on a cloudy day because we could of got wet while working and the grass would of got all sloppy. This event was very likely to occur because the weather channel said it was going to rain today the time we were working. If it did rain, it would affect the project because the workers and I would get soaked and the final outcome would look sloopy from the rain sinking in the grass.
<br>
<b> Solution:</b> Check the weather before we arrive at the house. If it says it might rain, talk to the recipient and maybe change the date if they approve.
<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Medium impact. The landscaping can still go on, but we will get wet and the grass will look messy. Also some equipment will fail from water getting into the engine.  
<br>
<br>
<b>2) Equipment malfunction:</b> If one of the machines for landscaping broke down or didn't start, then we would be down a machine and part of this project would be missing. This event was unlikely to occur because we all checked the machines and made sure they were working properly before we arrived at the recipients house. If this occurred, the goal of the project wouldn't be met and the recipient would most likely be unhappy with the results.
<br>
<b> Solution:</b> Make sure all the equipment is working properly before we leave to go to the recipient's house.
<br>
<b>Impact:</b> High impact. The landscaping can not go on. If we are short a machine, a big part of the project will be missing and the final outcome wont be good. 
<br>
<br>
<b>3) Unexpected absences:</b> If one of the members wasn't able to work today, because of a sickness or personal issues, this would surely slow down the work process because we would be down a guy and a part of this project would be done by another member who isn't familiar with that role. The probability of this happening is 50/50 because you just never know what happenens to my members when they arent working. You don't know what's going on in their personal life. This would impact the project because a member would not be present during the work and his job would now be assigned to another member slowing down the process.
<br>
<b> Solution:</b> Make sure all members are able to make it the day before the job.
<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Medium impact. The landscaping can still go on, but this will slow down the work process. If we are missing a member, then someone else would have to do his job and that would just take more time.
<br>
<br>
<b>4) No energy:</b> If the members party all night before, they wouldn't get enough sleep and not work hard during the project. They would just go through the motions and not make sure it is perfect. This is unlikely to happen because the members of my team are all "older men" so I don't think they would ever do this. If they did party a lot the night before, the outcome wouldn't be good and goals would not be met.
<br>
<b> Solution:</b> Make a rule that if any member has no energy from being up all night and partying, I will shorten your pay. Amount shortened depends on amount of energy you have.
<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Medium impact. The landscaping can still go on, but the members will be tired and won't work as hard as they usually would. This would make the work process longer and the outcome won't be as good.
<br>
<br>
<b>5) Run out of supplies:</b> If all the members are working and we end up with no more gasoline for the machines, this is a huge problem because then we can't use the machines any longer until we buy more gasoline. This is likely to occur because we didn't bring any extra gas. We just filled up machines before we left and that was it. If we run out of gas, the project would not be completed. 
<br>
<b> Solution:</b> Make sure you have plenty of supplies before you arrive at the recipient's house. Bring extra supplies.
<br>
<b>Impact:</b> High impact. Halfway through if we run out of supplies, the landscaping cannot go on. If we run out of gasoline, then we can't run our machines to landscape the house. 
<br>
<br>
<b>6) Recipient unahppy:</b> If the members don't work hard, the recipient would not be happy and we risk getting bad reviews online. The probability of this is unlikely because we always work our hardest to make the final outcome look perfect and cleaned up. If this happened, we would have to hire better workers.
<br>
<b> Solution:</b> Work harder and don't show the recipient the final outcome until approved by me. 
<br>
<b>Impact:</b> High impact. The landscaping can not go on if the recipient is unhappy because if he/she doesn't like what we are doing, they can tell us to stop and then we can't work any longer until they tell us to do so. This can also slow down the work process.
<br>
<br>
<b>7) Run over rocks with lawnmower:</b> If we run over rocks with the lawnmower, that is a risk because the lawnmower can break down and the rocks may shoot out and hit someone. This is unlikely because we make sure we don't run anything over other than grass. If this did happen, the recipient would be very unhappy and give us bad reviews online.
<br>
<b> Solution:</b> Be extra careful to not get too close to the rocks. The mower should always stay at least 3 feet away from the rocks.
<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Medium impact. The landscaping can still go on, but we could be short of a machine or even a member. This will really slow down the work process, but we can still complete the job with what we have.
<br>
<br>
<b>8) Schedule changes:</b> If the recipient decides she wants us to come next Tuesday instead of this Tuesday, this is a risk because now some members might not be able to attend next tuesday and our whole plan would change. This is unlikely because the owner was very happy that we were coming and would probably never do that to us. If the date changed, then we will lose members and not complete the project right. 
<br>
<b> Solution:</b> Create a contract saying the recipient can not change the day we come and work. Once you find a day that works, you cannot change the day.
<br>
<b>Impact:</b> High impact. The landscaping can not go on. If the recipient changes the day we come, then we could be short a member because that member didn't know ahead of time. Also we can't work until he/she gives us a date we can work. 
<br>
<br>
<b>9) Change in requirements:</b> If the recipient decides she doesn't want the grass cut, but wants everyhting else, this will cause one member to not do anything. This is unlikely because if we are here, we just do everything. This would cause in a faster job and a member not doing anything.
<br>
<b> Solution:</b> Double check exactly what the recipient wants before we start the work. Also make a contract saying they can't change the requirmeents the day of the work.
<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Medium impact. The landscaping can still go on, but we may have to change a few rules. If the recipient decides she only wants the front of the house done, then we might have to change roles to the members and the cost will decrease for this project.
<br>
<br>
<b>10) Recipient gives us bad reviews:</b> If the recipient decides she wants to give us bad reviews, that will cause our business to collapse. This is unlikely.
<br>
<b> Solution:</b> Make sure the outcome is perfect enough where theer would be no reason to give us a bad review.
<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Medium impact. The landscaping can still go on, but we may not have as many customers as we usually had. This can result in our company loosing money.
