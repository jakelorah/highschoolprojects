<br>
<br>
<center>In English, I wrote a 4 paragraph RST paper. I had 40 minutes to write in class. It was due by the end of the period. Before I started writing, I asked myself some questions.</center>
<br>
<br>
<b>1. Do I know what is expected of me?</b>
<br>
Yes, I do know what is expected of me. My job is to create a 4 paragraph RST paper answering the promp the teacher assigned us. You must do the best you can and hand it in to the teacher at the end of the period.
<br>
<br>
<b>2. Do I expect to fulfill that expectation?</b>
<br>
Yes, I do believe that I can fulfill this expectation and get the job on on time and with quality. As long as I work hard and manage my time, I will get this assignment done on time. 
<br>
<br>
<b>3. Will the reward for performing well be of substantial value to me?</b>
<br>
Yes, the grade after I complete this assginment will effect my grade. This assignment is worth 40% of my final grade. I do believe that they are grading this fairly. 
<br>
<br>
<b>The overall outcome of this assignment is I finished the RST on time and with quality. I dont know my grade yet but I am sure it will be a B+ or higher.</b>
