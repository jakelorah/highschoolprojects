<font size="5">Project #1: Re-doing my whole kitchen in my house.</font>
<br>
<font size="4">
- My Dad and I had to repaint the walls, install new appliances, put down the tile, install furniture, and put in new countertops.We only hired someone for the plumbing for the sink and dishwasher.
<br>
<br>
- This took about 5 weeks in June into July. My Dad took some work days off and I just finished school.
<br>
<br>
- We needed many resources to complete everything. We needed to go to The Home Depot and Loews to buy everything. We also needed a big van to put everything in for transporting everything back home.
<br>
<br>
- This project was different from a task because it had a start and an end date and we did a lot of preperation before starting anything.
<br>
<br>
- The project as a result was a beautiful kitchen with all new furniture, appliances, tile, and paint. Overall, it was a successful job.
<br>
<br>
- An issue the project faced was installing the lights because my Dad and I couldn't figure out the wiring. Eventually, we called up a friend and he told us how to do it on the phone.
<br>
<br>
- Another issue my Dad and I faced was getting the fridge through our door into the kitchen. The fridge was to big so we had to go around the house, through the back door, and up a flight of stairs. 
<br>
<br>
- The practice my Dad and I applied was objectives. We had to establish a clear and achievable objective. We asked ourselves what tasks are needed to make this project a success. We double checked all measurments and made sure we are going to do everything right.
<br>
<br>
- Also, my Dad and I focused on Quality and Time. We had to decide how much time should we spend on this and still achieve the desired results. In our case, quality was more important than time. We spent a lot of time on this project to ensure that the finished result was perfect.
