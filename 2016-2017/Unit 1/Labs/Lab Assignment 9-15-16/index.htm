My big project was re-doing my kitchen with my Dad. During the project, we came past some problems. First of all, my Dad and I couldn’t figure out the electrical wiring so we had to call someone for some advice. Second, we couldn’t fit our fridge through our front door, so we had to bring it around the house thrugh the back door and up the stairs. The third problem was small. We didn’t have an outlet by the fridge so we just had to run an extension cord behind the cabinets. My Dad was the team leader in this project. He was in charge and he motivated me very well. My Dad being the team leader really helped me because he had a plan and he got everything organized for me so that when I entered the project, everything was set. Him being the team leader also helped the project itself because he kept making sure everything was on track and everything was going as planned.
