<br>
<br>
<font size="5">
<br>
<b>1) Weather:</b> We risked working on a cloudy day because we could of got wet while working and the grass would of got all sloppy. This event was very likely to occur because the weather channel said it was going to rain today the time we were working. If it did rain, it would affect the project because the workers and I would get soaked and the final outcome would look sloopy from the rain sinking in the grass.
<br>
<b>2) Equipment malfunction:</b> If one of the machines for landscaping broke down or didn't start, then we would be down a machine and part of this project would be missing. This event was unlikely to occur because we all checked the machines and made sure they were working properly before we arrived at the recipients house. If this occurred, the goal of the project wouldn't be met and the recipient would most likely be unhappy with the results.
<br>
<b>3) Unexpected absences:</b> If one of the members wasn't able to work today, because of a sickness or personal issues, this would surely slow down the work process because we would be down a guy and a part of this project would be done by another member who isn't familiar with that role. The probability of this happening is 50/50 because you just never know what happenens to my members when they arent working. You don't know what's going on in their personal life. This would impact the project because a member would not be present during the work and his job would now be assigned to another member slowing down the process.
<br>
<b>4) No energy:</b> If the members party all night before, they wouldn't get enough sleep and not work hard during the project. They would just go through the motions and not make sure it is perfect. This is unlikely to happen because the members of my team are all "older men" so I don't think they would ever do this. If they did party a lot the night before, the outcome wouldn't be good and goals would not be met.
<br>
<b>5) Run out of supplies:</b> If all the members are working and we end up with no more gasoline for the machines, this is a huge problem because then we can't use the machines any longer until we buy more gasoline. This is likely to occur because we didn't bring any extra gas. We just filled up machines before we left and that was it. If we run out of gas, the project would not be completed. 
<br>
<b>6) Recipient unahppy:</b> If the members don't work hard, the recipient would not be happy and we risk getting bad reviews online. The probability of this is unlikely because we always work our hardest to make the final outcome look perfect and cleaned up. If this happened, we would have to hire better workers.
<br>
<b>7) Run over rocks with lawnmower:</b> If we run over rocks with the lawnmower, that is a risk because the lawnmower can break down and the rocks may shoot out and hit someone. This is unlikely because we make sure we don't run anything over other than grass. If this did happen, the recipient would be very unhappy and give us bad reviews online.
<br>
<b>8) Schedule changes:</b> If the recipient decides she wants us to come next Tuesday instead of this Tuesday, this is a risk because now some members might not be able to attend next tuesday and our whole plan would change. This is unlikely because the owner was very happy that we were coming and would probably never do that to us. If the date changed, then we will lose members and not complete the project right. 
<br>
<b>9) Change in requirements:</b> If the recipient decides she doesn't want the grass cut, but wants everyhting else, this will cause one member to not do anything. This is unlikely because if we are here, we just do everything. This would cause in a faster job and a member not doing anything.
<br>
<b>10) Recipient gives us bad reviews:</b> If the recipient decides she wants to give us bad reviews, that will cause our business to collapse. This is unlikely.
