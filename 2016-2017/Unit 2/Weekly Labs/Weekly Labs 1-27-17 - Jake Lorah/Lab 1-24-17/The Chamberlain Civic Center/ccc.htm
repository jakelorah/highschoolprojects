      at the Chamberlain Civic Center, with performances of the award-winning 
      musical, <span>The Producers</span> by the Broadway Touring Company on
      March 4, 5, and 6. Tickets are going fast, so order yours today.</p>

     <p>Celebrate the season on March 11 with the Chamberlain Symphony and their 
        special selection of classical music with Spring themes. The next day, 
        March 12, exercise your mind by attending the Charles Dickens mystery 
        <span>Edwin Drood</span>.</p>

     <p>Jazz lovers have a lot to celebrate in March with a visit from <span>The 
        Jazz Masters</span> on the 17th. Then on March 24, enjoy the music of The 
        Duke with <span>An Ellington Tribute</span> performed by the Jazz Company 
        of Kansas City.</p>

     <p>Pins, bottles, plates, and chairs are flying at the Chamberlain Civic 
        Center in March. <span>The Taiwan Acrobats</span> return with another 
        amazing performance on Sunday, March 13. On March 20, the <span>Madtown 
        Jugglers</span> get into the act with their unique blend of comedy, juggling, 
        and madness.</p>

     <p>Enjoy a classical brunch every Sunday afternoon with music provided by the 
        Carson Quartet. Seating is limited, so please reserve your table.</p>
