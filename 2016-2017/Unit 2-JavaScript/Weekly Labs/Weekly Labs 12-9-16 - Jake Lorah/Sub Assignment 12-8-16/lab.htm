document.write("What is the modular code approach?" + "<br>");
document.write("Modular code approach organizes code into small, easily manageable chunks." + "<br>");
document.write("Describe the benefits of using modular code." + "<br>");
document.write("Development time can be reduced, code becomes more reliable, and code can be easily transported." + "<br>");
document.write("Name and describe the 4 basic flowchart shapes." + "<br>");
document.write("The four flowchart shapes are rectangles, which are the process, parallelograms which control the data, diamonds which are for decisions, and ovals for the start and end of the flow chart." + "<br>");
document.write("Explain which types of errors can be prevented by flowcharting and why." + "<br>");
document.write("Logical and runtime errors could be avoided by using this technique because the flowchart is similar to a roughdraft of the real code, allowing you to spot mistakes beforehand." + "<br>");
document.write("Describe the process of debugging logical errors." + "<br>");
document.write("When debugging logical errors, you can display the value during every step of the program to track the variables each step of the way.");

document.write("1. Specify the code to access the JavaScript file library.js." + "<br>");
document.write("The code is an opened and close script tag in the head section of the code." + "<br>");
document.write("2. Specify the code to enter the single-line JavScript comment Library of JavaScript functions." + "<br>");
document.write("/* enter comment here */" + "<br>");
document.write("3. Specify the  code to enter following multiline JavaScript comment: The library .js file contains a collection of JavaScript functions for use with the file index.htm." + "<br>");
document.write("This comment is telling us that the .js file contains functions that can be connected back to index.htm." + "<br>");
document.write("4. What is bebugging?" + "<br>");
document.write("The process of identifying and correcting those errors is known as debugging code." + "<br>");
document.write("5. What code would you enter to display the value of the userName variable in an alert dialog box?" + "<br>");
document.write("alert(VALUE OF USERNAME);");
document.write("6. What are the three types of errors generated by mistakes in a JavaScript program?" + "<br>");
document.write("The three errors are load-time, run-time, and logical errors." + "<br>");
document.write("7. Your code has a mispelled variable name. What type of error will result from the mistake?" + "<br>");
document.write("This is an example of a runtime error.");
